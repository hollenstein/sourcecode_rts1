By David M. Hollenstein

### Execution
---------------------------------------------------------
1. Download the MaxQuant.zip file from the PRIDE repository and unzip them into the "MaxQuant" directory (actually only the evidence.txt file would be required).
2. Running the process_evidence.py scripts generates processed and customized evidence, phospho site and protein tables, which are saved to the "tables" directory.
3. Running the phosphosite_table.py scripts generates the summarized phospho site tables used in the manuscript.

### Environment requirements
---------------------------------------------------------
- `Python 3` https://www.python.org/
- Python packages: `NumPy`, `pandas`, `MasPy`
